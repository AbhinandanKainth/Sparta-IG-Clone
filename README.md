Uncommited change? It means that your change is not committed yet. 
Git is not tracking it right now. 

TO ensure that git is tracking it you commit your change. 



Committing your change has two parts.
1. First your commit in your local system.
2. You push it to origin

What is origin? Your hosted git repo. 

To download my code: 
You will do
`git clone https://github.com/AbhinandanKainth/Sparta-IG-Clone.git`
